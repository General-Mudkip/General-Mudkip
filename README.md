"When you think back on your life,
And you're 95, a hundred years old,
And you look back over the course of your lifetime
You're not gonna think
I wish I owned a better phone,
I wish I spent more time on the internet,
I wish I spent more time at work or sleeping,
It's not gonna be any of those kinds of things.
It's gonna be I wish I spent more time with the people I love."
